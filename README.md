Mutual Aid Toolkit

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to @queerviolet for inspiration for this and for taking the time out on a weekend to walk me through their contactless delivery proof-of-concept. 

## Why I Built This

COVID-19 hit and after a few weeks of waiting around for groups in Chicago to do anything other than pressure campaigns, a bunch of different affinity groups and unaffiliated individuals coalesced together for a city-wide network of mutual aid and tenant organizing. Many Zoom calls were had and a lot of the struggle revolved around how to reach the most people, especially when the most access to computing resources is likely a smartphone.  

After talking to a lot of helpful people, both locally and nationally, there were a lot of complicated workflows that essentially revolved around a person checking a Google form multiple times a day and then dispatching that work via Slack/Discord/Text/Email. We found that this tends to really burn out the dispatch coordinators, which is really the last thing we need right now.  

## Objectives

The major points of this project were to:
* reduce the burden of effort on individuals
* lower the barrier to entry for volunteers
* enable access to those without computing resources

It's written in Javascript, which is the one universal language for all of these APIs.  The idea was to keep it serverless and easy for anyone to customize, from an advanced developer to someone with time to blow and the ability to use Google. If you find a bug or wanna fix something, please open a PR and I'll be happy to take a look.
